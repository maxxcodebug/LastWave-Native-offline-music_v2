/**
 * Publishes what is playing to Discord as a Rich Presence activity.
 *
 * Behaviour is ported from the desktop client
 * (`LastWave-Desktop/lib/features/presence/discord_presence_service.dart`):
 * push on track or play-state change, never on the position ticker; stay silent
 * when Discord is absent, refuses, or rate-limits; clear the card the moment
 * playback stops or the switch is turned off.
 *
 * Two throttles, both inherited from desktop and both load-bearing:
 * - [DiscordPresence.PUSH_INTERVAL_MS] on a signature of everything the card
 *   shows, so the ~16 Hz position stream costs at most one frame per interval.
 * - [DiscordPresence.RETRY_INTERVAL_MS] on connection attempts, because the
 *   common case is a user who simply does not have Discord installed and that
 *   must never be polled harder than the push cadence.
 *
 * A slow heartbeat re-evaluates on the same interval as the push throttle, so
 * presence can never go quietly stale (missed snapshot, Discord restarted while
 * paused, a push dropped by a dead transport).
 *
 * Playback is never touched, delayed or gated by anything in here: every
 * failure is swallowed and every frame is fire-and-forget.
