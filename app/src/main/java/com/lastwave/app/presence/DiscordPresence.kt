/**
 * Discord Rich Presence ("Listening to LastWave") payload builder.
 *
 * Ported field for field from the desktop client
 * (`LastWave-Desktop/lib/features/presence/discord_presence_service.dart`) so a
 * user's profile reads identically on both apps: same application id, same
 * `type`, same line layout, same two buttons, same asset keys, same clip
 * lengths. Only the transport differs (see [DiscordSdkTransport]) — on Android
 * the Discord app itself hosts the endpoint, so there is no `discord-ipc-N`
 * socket to hand-roll the way the desktop build does.
 *
 * The card one [buildActivity] call produces:
 * ```
 *   Listening to LastWave            <- type 2 (listening) + name
 *   ┌────┐  Song title               <- details
 *   │art │  Artist                   <- state, first line
 *   └────┘   · Hi-Res Lossless · 24-bit · 96 kHz    <- state, second line
 *           ▁▁▁▁▁▁ 1:04 / 3:47       <- from the timestamps
 *   [ Listen On LastWave ]           <- opens the track
 *   [ Get LastWave ]                 <- opens this project's releases
 * ```
 *
 * Deliberately free of Android and Discord SDK types: every rule here is pure,
 * so the format is unit-testable on the JVM and can never drift from the
 * desktop client's without a test failing.
 *
 * Quality is only ever what was measured. Where the desktop client could read a
 * real channel count off its output device, [MusicPlayerState] has no such
 * field, so the trailing layout slot carries the spatial badge the stream's
 * codec actually reports ([spatialIndicatorLabel]) and is simply absent
 * otherwise — never a guessed `Stereo`.
